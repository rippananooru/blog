Ride legally on the road?

Where to begin?

How does the licensing work in Malaysia?

If you plan to ride a motorcycle legally on the street, you obviously need a license to begin with.

Here's are video version of the guide but in MALAY language.

Up till today I often saw riders hiding from police roadblock because of not having a license when riding. 
For me there is no fun and no reason not to have your license and legally having fun on your two wheels on the road. 
It's totally ruined your excitement to get home with a ticket.

In Malaysia there are 3 categories of motorcycle license.
- B - 500cc above
- B1 - between 250cc and 500cc
- B2 - below than 250cc

But the most common is B2 or the B full.
Since there's no request for a B1 license and also there's less motorcycle in the market filling that size category the B1 looks like it doesn't exist.

# THE PROCESS

Generally there's only one way to obtain your license which is through driving school.
But you need to realise there is no fixed price in this business since some schools offer some services with extra charges. You can find any school nearby your place and get some inquiries.

There are 2 categories to begin with.
- Those without any motorcycle license
- Owning B2 license and upgrading to B full license

## START FROM ZERO

For those in the first category, obviously you need to take an extra step to obtain your license. This is the same for those who plan to get any type of license.
Here is the breakdown. 

*You can directly get B full license even without any motorcycle license before.*

1. Register with driving school.
2. Attend class. (hours need to refer with your school)
3. Computer test.
4. Get your L license. (training license) - if passed the computer test
5. On track lesson with driving school.
6. Test with JPJ ( Road Transport Department)
7. Obtain your license - if you passed the JPJ test

## LET'S GET BIGGER

So you feel that small cc bikes are not enough for you and ready to take on the bigger ponies? The process is almost the same but if you already got your B2 license here is the breakdown.

1. Get your L license (training license) - register with JPJ. 
    Bring along passport photo and RM20.
2. Register with driving school for the B full license.
3. On track lesson with driving school.
4. Test with JPJ.
5. Obtain your license - if you passed the JPJ test

See, it's not that hard actually to ride legally on the road.
Your license will be valid for **12 months** 
and normally JPJ will have the license to expire on your **birthday**
so it is easier to remember.

That's the end of this writing. Whenever or whatever bike you are on, **RIDE SAVE!**
